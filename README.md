# VSCode - Sort JSON (Stable)

The `vscode-json-stable-stringify` extension is used to sort a JSON object using the [`json-stable-stringify` sort mechanism](https://github.com/substack/json-stable-stringify") to create a standardized, sorted JSON object.

While it will use the editor's current settings for indentation, it otherwise uses default settings for the sort.

## Features

This extension implements the document formatter for JSON so you can use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and execute `Format Document` to format the whole document. You may also select a subset of a document that is valid JSON (e.g., something inside an HTML doc or a JavaScript doc) and use the `Sort JSON (Stable)` command to format just the selected content.
